        Hello, I’m Kingsley Omin a Product Designer passionate about solving problems using the
        user-centred design approach to simplifying the solution that also accommodates new users.
        I’m currently based in Lagos, Nigeria. My design process usually involves design thinking
        which starts by empathising with the users and understanding the problem, then research and
        analyze to gain more insights, prototype and test to see if the solution works, then further
        analysis again to achieve a better product that is usable and memorable. <br />
        <br />
        I work across user research, UX design, UI design, prototyping and product testing because I
        believe that great design isn't just about creating something that looks good, It's about
        creating simple and delightful products that are accessible and easy to use. I’m constantly
        captivated by the possibilities that design and technology can bring, so I stay motivated to
        create impact across the world with my designs.
        <br />With design being so versatile, I'm passionate about improving and helping others grow
        in the field and also cultivating meaningful relationships. I am always hungry to learn more
        about human-centred design because I have a passion for creating beautiful and delightful
        experiences. <br /><br />
        When I’m not designing, I enjoy playing video games (soccer), watch my favourite team
        Barcelona play or lifting weight at the gym to keep fit . I love blue because it signifies
        calmness and white is also beautiful. I’m excited to help you turn your ideas into something
        usable.
